	             <p>YOU WILL GUESS WHAT LETTER MASTER YODA IS THINKING OF. YOU HAVE THE RANGE OF THE ALPHABET. IN OTHER WORDS,
	              YOU CAN CHOOSE A LETTER BETWEEN A - Z. OBVIOUSLY, THE ODDS ARE NOT VERY GOOD. 1 IN 26, REALLY. HOWEVER, IF YOU REQUIRE
	              ASSISTANCE, MASTER YODA WILL HELP YOU. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ASK!</p>
				<p>BY THE WAY, ISN'T THIS COOL? I FOUND THIS SCROLLING STAR WARS THEME WHILE COMPLETING THIS PROJECT. I FIGURED IT WOULD GO WELL WITH THE THEME.</p>
				<p>YEAH, IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK, BUT IT AIN'T BAD!</p>
				<p>LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK!</p>
              	<p>GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!!</p>
              	<p>AND, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!</p>
